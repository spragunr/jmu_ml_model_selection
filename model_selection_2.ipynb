    "## Activity 3 - Cross Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous activity, we made the classic mistake of using our validation data to predict our generalization error. This tends to give misleadingly optimistic predictions about how well we will do on unobserved data. Remember that we carefully picked our hyperparameter values to do as well as possible *on our held-out data*. We shouldn't be surprised when our model performs better on that data than on unobserved data. This problem is particularly acute if our testing set is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traditional solution is to divide our data set into three disjoint sets: **training**, **validation**, and **testing**:\n",
    "* The **training** set is used to fit the model\n",
    "* The **validation** set is used to evaluate models for the purpose of hyperparameter selection. \n",
    "* The **test** set is kept in a locked room guarded by jaguars. We only look at the testing set ONCE, when we have finalized our model. That way our performance on the test set gives us an unbiased estimate of our generalization error.\n",
    "\n",
    "This traditional approach is fine if we have a lot of data to work with. If the data set is small, we are faced with a painful dilemma: More validation data means better model selection. More testing data means more accurate model evaluation. More training data means better models. Any data we use for one purpose can't be used for the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross validation** is one way to use limited data more effectively.  The cells below walk us through an example of using cross validation for hyperparameter tuning."
